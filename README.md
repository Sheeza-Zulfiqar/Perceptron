# Perceptron
In perceptron, we are provided with neuron and structure of neuron contains soma where sum is stored and activation function after which output will be provided.
The sum of all the weights and bias value along with weights is stored in soma. 
If predicted and actual output match, then there is no error and we can move to next instance but if they do not match then error will be calculated and after that the weights of each dendrite as well as bias value are updated which can be used for next instance
This process goes on until the error becomes minimum in a specific epoch on a specific weight and bias value.
